This package provides code navigation for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

What is included?
  * Navigate to the definition of your global PHP constants and functions.
  * Navigate to the PHP documentation of built-in classes and functions by alt-clicking them.
  * Navigate to the definition of classes, traits and interfaces by alt-clicking them.
  * Navigate to the definition of class, trait and interface members by alt-clicking them.

Tip: You can also alt-click the names of classes, interfaces and traits inside docblocks! If an item is *navigable*, it will be underlined when moving your mouse over it while holding the alt modifier key.
